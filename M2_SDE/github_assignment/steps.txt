Step 1: Project Initialization
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Create a new folder for the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir sample-project
   cd sample-project
   ```
3. Initialize Git:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
4. Create a new repository on GitHub named "sample-project".
5. Link the local repository to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/AyushOJOD/Sample_project.git
   ```
6. Create an initial file and push:
   ```bash
   echo "# Sample Project" > README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

Step 2: Adding the README.md File
1. Create and switch to a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/update-readme
   ```
2. Open the README.md file in a text editor and add:
   ```markdown
   # Sample Project

   This project is designed to demonstrate Git and GitHub workflows.
   ```
3. Stage and commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Added project introduction to README"
   ```
4. Push the branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/update-readme
   ```

Step 3: Merging Changes
1. Open a pull request on GitHub for `feature/update-readme`.
2. Add a description and submit the pull request.
3. Review and merge the pull request into the main branch.

Step 4: Cleaning Up the Feature Branch
1. Switch back to the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
2. Delete the feature branch locally:
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/update-readme
   ```
3. Delete the feature branch remotely:
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete feature/update-readme
